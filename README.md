# gecko-butler
Telegram bot that uses Google's [Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/).  
Made with help from [this example](https://github.com/FollonSaxBass/python-telegram-bot-GAE) by [FollonSaxBass](https://github.com/FollonSaxBass) to set up Google App Engine.  
Uses [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) API.

**Note:** There is a bug with the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library and Google App Engine, as described [here](https://github.com/wooyek/flask-social-blueprint/issues/18) along with a fix.
